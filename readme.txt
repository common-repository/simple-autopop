A simple calendar that calls the EventUpon API to pull the next three events from the organizations you’ve selected!

== Description ==

This calendar typically works in conjunction with the standard EventUpon calendar [link](https://wordpress.org/plugins/eventupon-calendar/). The standard calendar displays all of the events. The simple calendar displays the next events in chronological order. By default, it will display three but it is configurable. For example, you could use this as a preview calendar on your homepage.

We have events from thousands of organizations. Select any two and you’ll get their events on your calendar for free. EventUpon has events from Meetup, EventBrite, TicketLeap and thousands of other organizations which post their events in Google calendars, iCal, Facebook and other event sources. Want more organization’s events? The first two organizations are free. After that it costs just $3 per organization plus $10 for the calendar per month. Small businesses and small non-profits get 50% off. Don’t see the organization you want, let us know and we can probably get it for you.

If you have your own events, you can AutoPOPulate your events to hundreds of thousands of targeted event goers for FREE!

Add your event in EventUpon.com and your event will be viewable on your Simple AutoPOP plugin and:

* EventUpon.com
* EveryBlock.com
* all Event Calendar AutoPOP plugins
